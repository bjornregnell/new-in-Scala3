# How to build the slides

* Clone this repo or download the `.scala` files.

* Install scala-cli from https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/install

* Make sure you have `latexmk` on your path. See: https://www.latex-project.org/get/

* Run this in terminal:
```
scala-cli run . 
```

* If you have `latexmk` on your path then you can now find the [slides](https://github.com/bjornregnell/new-in-Scala3/blob/main/slides.scala) compiled to pdf in the `target` folder.

* Look at the [source](https://github.com/bjornregnell/new-in-Scala3/blob/main/api.scala) to see Scala 3 in action.
